    description: "What is Regenerix Gold?\nRegenerix Gold‚Ñ¢ is a special formulation that combines the powerful tissue repair ability of Regenerix with a unique fast acting herbal blend. With aging populations around the world, coupled with an increasing awareness of the importance of exercise, there is a rapidly growing epidemic of people suffering from neck, back, knee and other joint problems as a result of muscle injuries and joint degeneration. The emphasis of current medical care in most parts of the world for such conditions is heavily dependent on painkillers and surgery. This is associated with the risks of side effects and surgical complications. As a result, many patients resort to unproven alternative medical treatments and various ‚Äújoint support\n\ntype‚Äù glucosamine products.\n\nIngredients\nTwo of Regenerix Gold‚Ñ¢ main constituents are Hydrolyzed Collagen (type II) and a proprietary mixture of 5 traditional herbs. Hydrolyzed Collagen (Type II) is the breakthrough medical ingredient produced through the hydrolysis of chicken cartilage for it‚Äôs tissue repair ability. Due to its lighter molecular weight, it is easily absorbed intestinally and can accumulate in joint cartilage, stimulating the repair process. As part of a special proprietary blend, the 5 herbs used are renowned for their extremely potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nContent:\n60 capsules/bottle (Recommended 2 capulses per serving & 2 times a day) \neight: 150g\nBioCell Collagen 500mg\n(Hydrolyzed chicken sternal cartilage extract)\n-Hydrolyzed Collagen Type II 300mg\n- Chondroitin Sulfate 100mg\n- Hyaluronic Acid 50mg\n\nProprietary Herbal Blend 800mg\n-Boswelia Serrata extract\n- Winter Cherry\n- Tumeric extract\nGinger extract\nCat's claw extract",
